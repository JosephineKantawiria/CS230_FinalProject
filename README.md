# CS230_FinalProject

Welcome everyone to my final project for my Python class! In this in this assignment, we are expected to develop an interactive data-driven web-based Python application that shows our mastery of many coding concepts as we interact with data real world data. The data set I chose to use for this assignment is the National Parks in New York data. Below are some of the coding skills I have demonstrated in this assignment:

• Coding Fundamentals: data types, if statements, loops, formatting, etc. 
• Data Structures: Interact with lists, tuples, dictionaries (keys, values, items)
• Functions:  passing positional and optional arguments,  returning values
• Files: Reading data from a CSV file into a DataFrame
• Pandas: Module functions and DataFrames to manipulate large data sets
• MatPlotLib or pandas: Creating different types of charts
• StreamLit.io: Displaying interactive widgets and charts
